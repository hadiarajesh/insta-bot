## Built with
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - A modern programming language for Android/JVM that makes developers happier.

[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous programming

[Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.

## Installation

Add JitPack to your build.gradle.kts file
```
repositories {
    ...
    maven(url = "https://jitpack.io")
}
```

Add Gradle dependency to your build.gradle.kts file
```
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.hadiyarajesh:insta-bot:Tag")
}
```

## Quick start
Set your Instagram username and password in [Credentials.Kt](https://github.com/hadiyarajesh/insta-bot/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/Credentials.kt) file
```kotlin
object Credentials {
    const val USERNAME = "your_instagram_username"
    const val PASSWORD = "your_instagram_password"
}
```
Initialize InstagramBot class with credential value and call prepare method. Then, call login method to login into instagram. (Prepare method must be called before login method)
```kotlin
    val username = Credentials.USERNAME
    val password = Credentials.PASSWORD

    val bot = InstagramBot()
    bot.prepare(username)
    bot.login(username, password)
 ```

Now you can perform any operations of your choice like. 
```kotlin
// Get 100 followers of you
bot.getSelfFollowers(100).collect { println(it) }
// Like 5 medias from explore page
bot.likeMediasByExplorePage(5).collect { println(it) }
// Approve all pending follow requests
bot.approveAllPendingFollowRequests().collect { println(it) }
// Watch stories of 200 users based on given location
bot.watchLocationUsersStories("enter_location_name_here", 200).collect { println(it) }
```
